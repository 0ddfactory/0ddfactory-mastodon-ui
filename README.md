0ddfactory UI for Mastodon  
The primary goal of this theme is to mimick the material you mastodon themes in the mobile app and its forks like megalodon or make any other changes I may want for 0ddfactory.

DONE:
* Change color scheme to match neutral Material You colors.
* Switch navigation and compose columns back to default mastodon order as this is not meant to replicate twitter.
* Change mastodon branding icon to generic greeting above nav panel and hid generic server message above banner.
* Change user icons to be squircle shaped like the mastodon mobile app
* Made pfp border thicker and match bg
* Disabled flex grow for compositional panel to avoid timeline uncentering and set both side panels to fixed size
* Make floating video player header/footer transparent

TODO:
* potentially change icons on navbar to be more consistent
* multi-column ui changes mayhaps
* mayhaps change very professional readme
* ???
* profit (not really this is free lmao)
