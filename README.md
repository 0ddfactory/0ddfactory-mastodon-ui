0ddfactory UI for Mastodon  

Done:
* Change color scheme to match neutral Material You colors.
* Switch navigation and compose columns back to default mastodon order as this is not meant to replicate twitter.
* Change mastodon branding icon to generic greeting above nav panel.
* Change user icons to be squircle shaped like the mastodon mobile app
* Disabled flex grow for compositional panel to avoid timeline uncentering

TODO:
* potential color improvements
* multi-column ui changes
* mayhaps change very professional readme
* ???
* profit
