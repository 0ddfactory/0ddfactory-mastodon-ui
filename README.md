## Mastodon, but it's Twitter

Blasphemy! Yes, I know, but I just had to do this. I wanted to see if it's possible to get <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon">Mastodon</a> default user interface to look exactly like Twitter.

**Please note** that this is a personal experiment _for fun_, but as far as I know colors can't be trademarked. No logos or other elements have been used without permission.

See the [original post](https://mementomori.social/@rolle/109984108360395822).

## Why would anyone want Mastodon to look like Twitter?

Because you can? Let's face it, we're kinda used to it, Mastodon already resembles Twitter. Twitter UI is not bad, it's just that it's not for everyone. Twitter made some bad choices with the new UI for example with the typography, so in a sense I wanted to see if I could make Mastodon look **like Twitter, but better**.

This is why I have defaulted Mastodon deep purple colors in this "theme", if you will. If you really want the vanilla Twitter-look, please modify the colors yourself. Or go to the hellsite if you really love it so much.

### Features

As this is CSS-only, they are not really "features" but more like aesthetic changes.

- CSS variables for everything
- Threaded replies
- Avatars on the left in feed view
- Unified transparent backgrounds
- Dark patterns for dropdowns and other pop overs like emoji picker
- Tinted deep purple, subtle beautiness
- Action bar in the bottom on mobile


## Installation for Mastodon instance admins

1. Make sure _Mastodon (Dark)_ is enabled in the **Site theme** setting
2. Copy the contents of style.css
3. Install it as CSS to your assets or use Custom CSS in the Appearance settings in your instance

### Twitter-like link previews

If you like bigger link previews, please implement [this](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/21874#issuecomment-1332556018).

## Installation for regular users, contributing and testing

1. Install [live-css-editor](https://github.com/webextensions/live-css-editor) (or any other extension that allows you to inject CSS into web pages) or use [Unite for macOS](https://www.bzgapps.com/unite)
2. Get style.css from this repo
3. Open extension and paste the CSS into the editor
4. Click ðŸ“Œ-icon so the styles will be remembered for the domain or if you want just to use it as needed, activate styles from the extension's popup

### Goals

- **CSS only.** This means some pseudos and modern CSS hacks. The intent is to have the code base as simple and extendable as possible. The styles should be easily modifiable. Ready-made code works when placed in _Custom CSS_ box in {yourinstance.social/mementomori.social/admin/settings/appearance}
- **Single-column layout only.** This experiment is not meant for advanced layout.

### Roadmap

- [x] Desktop views
- [x] Mobile views
- [x] Star to heart
