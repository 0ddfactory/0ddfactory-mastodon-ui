0ddfactory UI for Mastodon  
The primary goal of this theme is to mimick the material you mastodon themes in the mobile app and its forks like megalodon.

DONE:
* Change color scheme to match neutral Material You colors.
* Switch navigation and compose columns back to default mastodon order as this is not meant to replicate twitter.
* Change mastodon branding icon to generic greeting above nav panel and hid generic server message above banner.
* Change user icons to be squircle shaped like the mastodon mobile app
* Made pfp border thicker and match bg
* Disabled flex grow for compositional panel to avoid timeline uncentering and set both side panels to fixed size
* Make floating video player header/footer transparent

TODO:
* potentially change icons on navbar to be more consistent
* multi-column ui changes mayhaps
* mayhaps change very professional readme
* ???
* profit (not really this is free lmao)
