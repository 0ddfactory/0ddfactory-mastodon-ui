## Mastodon, but it's Twitter

Blasphemy! Yes, I know, but I just had to do this. I wanted to see if it's possible to get <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon">Mastodon</a> default user interface to look exactly like Twitter.

Please note that this is a personal experiment _for fun_, but as far as I know colors can't be trademarked. No logos or other elements have been used without permission. Twitter reuses [FontAwesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) for icons.

### Goals

- **CSS only.** This means some pseudos and modern CSS hacks. The intent is to have the code base as simple and extendable as possible. The styles should be easily modifiable. Ready-made code works when placed in _Custom CSS_ box in {yourinstance.social/mementomori.social/admin/settings/appearance}
- **Single-column layout only.** This experiment is not meant for advanced layout.

### Roadmap

- [x] Desktop views
- [ ] Mobile views
- [ ] Star to like heart with animation

## Installation

1. Copy the contents of style.css
2. Install it as CSS to your assets or use Custom CSS in the Appearance settings in your instance

## Contributing / testing

1. Install [live-css-editor](https://github.com/webextensions/live-css-editor) (or any other extension that allows you to inject CSS into web pages) or use [Unite for macOS](https://www.bzgapps.com/unite)
2. Get style.css from this repo
3. Open extension and paste the CSS into the editor
4. Click ðŸ“Œ-icon so the styles will be remembered for the domain or if you want just to use it as needed, activate styles from the extension's popup
